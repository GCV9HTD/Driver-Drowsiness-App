## Mobile Application for Driver Awareness Detection using Deep Learning 

1. Tensor is sent to BlazeFace Model for face detection 
2. If face is detected the face is cropped based on the bounding boxes 
3. Cropped faces are resized to fit the custom model (1,224,224,3)
4. Awareness detection is performed on the cropped and resized face.
